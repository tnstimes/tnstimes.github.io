		<h1>Sign the TNS Times Petition!</h1>
		<p>
			Singapore is known for its tropical climate, with high humidity and its temperatures often exceeding 30 degrees Celsius.
			In fact, temperatures have been known to reach up to 34 degrees Celsius on average during the hottest months (source: NEA).
			The high heat can be particularly challenging for students at Tao Nan School, who are required to wear formal uniforms (during non-PE days) that may not be optimal in such conditions.
			The use of PE attire as a daily uniform would provide a more comfortable and practical solution.
			These uniforms are designed to be breathable and lightweight, making them ideal for the hot weather. 
			By allowing students to wear PE attire regardless of their activities, we can ensure that our students remain comfortable and focused on their education instead of being frustrated with the excessive heat. 
			Let's prioritise student comfort and wellbeing in our school dress code. 
			Please sign this petition to allow students to wear PE attire at Tao Nan School every day!
